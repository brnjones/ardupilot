/*
 *   The AP_Mission library:
 *   - Holds a three element array with the previous, current, and after waypoints.
 *   - Conditional and Do commands associated with the current leg may be requested
 *   - Reads and writes the mission MAVLINK commands to and from storage.
 *   - Performs error checking on waypoint values.
 *   - Keeps track of the indicies of current nav command and non_nav_waypoints.
 *   - Accounts for the DO_JUMP command in how is sequences waypoints.
